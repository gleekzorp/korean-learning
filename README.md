  - I just recently came across her channel and I have liked it so far
  - For instance yesterday I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHC517q1KfM which was a Letâ€™s Practice Thinking in Korean & Boost Your Speaking.  It looks like she could have some fun and engaging lessons she works hard on planning her classes from what I could tell from this one
