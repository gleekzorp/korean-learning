# CrossWords!

These are the crosswords that I have created during my Korean Class which involved memorizing some words each week.  I used https://www.armoredpenguin.com/crossword/ to create them but I was worried they would eventually no longer exist at that website so I saved them as pdf for easy use on my phone.  It's great to use a phone or tablet that has a pen because you can easily reuse these over and over again instead of printing and only getting one use.
